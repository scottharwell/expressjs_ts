Express.JS Starter with Typescript
==================================

This is a simple starter project that is effectively a port of the auto-generated JS code from the express.js application generator.  I wanted something that would give me effectively the same application shell, but completely in TypeScript for my projects.  Most of the www code has been moved to a class in app.js for ease of maintenance.

This shell works just like running an JS app generated from the tool.  Run `npm start` from the root of the project to start the HTTP server on port 3000 and the index page will appear when a request is made to localhost.

# Installation

* Clone the repo to your machine.
* Navigate to the repo.
* Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
* Transpile TypeScript to JavaScript by running `tsc`.
* Run `npm start` to run the web server.

Now, code away in TypeScript!
